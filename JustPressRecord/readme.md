to do the export I first make sure that my just press record app is using my icloud for storage

Then I stop recording

Then I go to files on my iphone and long press the just press record application data file and press compress

Then I wait for it to compress, and upload, and then go onto icloud in my browser and download the file



after it's downloaded I move it to dataExports/justPressRecord/DATEOFEXPORT/

then after it's extracted, and checked for corruption, then I delete the export on icloud, and delete the application folder.

then I start recording again
